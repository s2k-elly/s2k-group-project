VER 0.1.0 (CURRENT):
+ Continued with polishing (process done manually as ChatGPT struggled to follow more detailed lines of questioning while maintaining expected logic).
    > Fixed error-handling sometimes double-printing messages.
    > Fixed error-handling sometimes printing contradictory messages.
    > Made case 6 of showMainMenu() not display unless currentUser is an Owner, and pretend to not exist if attempted to be accessed outside of an Owner instance.
    > Documented methods that were not present in the Class UML but, in the end, proved to be important for the maintenance of modularity.
    > Fixed a few non-stylized error/success messages to be more uniform with the rest.
    > Made defineGameAdd() in MainUI.java perform while loops to catch errors in regard to empty/null Titles and Descriptions, and make the I/O process less annoying for the user if a mistake is made.

VER 0.0.1:
+ Manually fixed ChatGPT mistakes.
    > Two unasked for, unused methods were removed.
    > A few naming conventions were fixed in accordance to Class UML and service package naming accuracy.
    > A few methods asking for incorrect parameters were adjusted to adhere with those in the services package.
    > Made the toString() in User and Videogame more user-friendly.
- Stubs and drivers removed, as they were outdated in function and naming, and code can now run well enough to be debugged through main args and start().

VER 0.0.0 (NOT PUSHED TO GITHUB):
+ All modules implemented after being tested by their respective teammate with stubs and drivers to ensure full isolated functionality of each source file.
+ Code collected via Discord fileshare as multiple members faced issues with pushing code to the GitHub repository.
    > KATRAMADOS --> models/
    > KALOUDIS --> ui/ & exceptions/
    > SKARAKI --> services/ & changelog & editing of merged code
+ Code predominantly AI generated via ChatGPT, with extensive guidance from notes and Class UML adherence.
